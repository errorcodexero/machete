HIGH PRIORITY for Season:
	- Drivebase
	- Gun
	- Bunny manipulator


NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY for Season:
	- Fix talon srx initialization: separate address for cans and access for them in the talon_srx_controls array
	- Log Analysis - Nick
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Clean up panel interpret
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs


LOG LIST:
	-RIO Time			10chars 
	-RIO mode			4chars
	-Collector Mode			4chars
	-Climber Mode			4chars
	-OI inputs (panel)		50chars
	-PDP currents			120chars
	-Robot Outputs			130chars
	-Robot Inputs			30chars
	-Driver inputs			120chars
	-RIO Connection status and ip	12chars
	-DriverStation outputs		4chars
					488 chars total


Eric's random thoughts:
	-I should try to figure out how the learning logic interacts w/ going into auto, etc.
	-Nav stuff should be a little more collected together
	-Sim stuff could benefit from using Monitor
	-Some of the nav types aren't following the naming convention
	-I should try to figure out what the Joy_collector_position logic is doing
	-Why is there a variable 'simtest' in main?
	-Don't do this before Auburn: There shouldn't be seperate "panel output" and driver station output
	-There's a better way to do SLOW_PRINT
	-Probably not this season: Should try to put a little more structure so that autonomous modes are less prone to be spaghetti-like
